  This paper examines the effects of the extreme candidates winning in the primary elections on their party's general election outcomes. Following the method from Hall's study, this paper uses regression discontinuity design to estimate the causal effect of an extremist's victory by focusing on the candidates who narrowly win or lose primary elections. In extension, I estimated the same regression model using the DIME data set with more recent data. The regression results from the replication of Hall's study suggest that extremist wins negatively affect general election outcomes. In contrast, the results using the DIME dataset suggest that the effects of extremists' wins are positive in both 1980-2010 and 1979-2020 except for one specification. The difference in the direction of the effects may be due to the difference in measures of ideology, which requires further research.

# Introduction 

Political polarization has been accelerating in many countries, particularly in the U.S.[^1]
A recent analysis by Pew Research shows that there are only a few dozen moderate congresspersons compared to more than 160 in 1971-1972, and the root of the political polarization goes back decades, which implies the future consequences of current political polarization.
[^2] Although presidential elections tend to garner more attention than elections of the House of Representatives, they, too, have long-lasting impacts on the district and subsequent representation in Congress
. Thus, the consequences of electing extremists to the House of Representatives are worth investigating
.

In a study by @Hall, Hall examined the causal relationship between extreme candidates' winning in primary elections and the general election outcomes by analyzing the primary election data for the House of Representatives [@hall2015].
The study utilized the random assignment of politicians winning the election around the margin of 0.
He found that in close elections, extremists' wins have a causal effect on an increase in general election vote share by 9-13 percentage points and increased probability for the party for the general election by 35-54 percentage points.
Moreover, the study found that in the years after the election, political representation of the district is likely to reverse.
This is possibly because when an extremist candidate wins a primary election, it could encourage other politicians from the district with relatively extreme ideology to run for an election or motivate the other party to put more effort into the election campaign.
Primary elections also better reflect the ideological preference of the voters since the primary voters choose a candidate within the same party, whereas general election voters choose candidates across different parties.
In extension, instead of the data used in Hall's study, which used the data from 1980 to 2010, I use the Database on Ideology, Money in Politics, and Elections (DIME), which has data up to 2020.
Using newer data, this study tries to see if the exact causal relationship between extremist candidates' wins in primary elections and general election outcomes holds.

In both replication and extension, I used the regression discontinuity (RD) designs.
RD designs have been relatively rigorously developed and has the advantage of creating quasi-experimental estimates in settings where individuals cannot precisely manipulate their assignment [@lee2010].
However, it is also necessary to note that some studies discuss the limitations of RDD in analyzing election data.
To estimate a causal relationship, the observations near the cutoff need to be used so that those assigned the control near the cutoff serve as counterfactuals of those assigned treatment.
A distinct feature of politician characteristic regression discontinuity is that politician characteristics are pre-determined [@marshall2022].
@Marshall (2015) argues that due to the nature of PCRD, which uses a pre-determined characteristic for an assignment variable, PCRD estimates cannot be interpreted as a result of one distinct characteristic of the treatment group politicians but should be interpreted as a consequence of a group of characteristics that differ between the two groups, which is the point reinforced by [@bertoli2023].
 

# Data

This paper utilizes the replication data of Hall (2015), originally compiled by Ansolabehere et al., which has data on primary and general election outcomes of candidates by each year, district, and party as well as their ideology score [@hall2015].
The samples in the replication dataset had years from 1980 to 2010 and they were primary elections between an extreme and moderate candidates where the treatment was extremist's win.
The ideological score *absdist* was used to identify elections between extreme and moderate candidates, and samples were included when they had above the median difference in ideological score between the two candidates.
Hall's study used the estimated ideological positions developed by Hall's previous study.
It is based on campaign receipts of primary elections and estimated using the ideological position of their donors of donation.
Since the study tries to identify the effects of an extreme candidate barely winning, all observations were close elections, which were identified by the size of the difference between the vote share of the top two candidates.
Specifically, winning margin, *rv*, is calculated as the ratio of extremist's vote share to the sum of moderate and extremist candidates' vote share minus 0.5, and its absolute value is the variable *margin*.

Treatment status, the main independent variable, was determined by whether an extreme candidate won the election.

In extending Hall's study, I used the Database on Ideology, Money in Politics, and Elections (DIME).[^3]
DIME dataset contains data on primary and general election outcomes, donation recipients, and political party for each candidate from the years 1979 to 2020.
It also has CF scores, another measure of ideology, which were developed by Bonica by utilizing campaign finance data.
Following the methodology of @Hall (2015), I identified elections between an extreme and moderate candidates by keeping observations with the CF scores larger than its median value.
The outcome variables in replication and extension are general election vote share, which takes the value between 0 and 1, and general election victory, which is a binary variable, taking the value one if the candidate wins the general election.

![Summary Statistics - Replication of Hall 2015](images/summary_stats_rep.png){#fig-sum_stats_1 fig-align="center" width="72%"}

@fig-sum_stats_1 above shows the mean values of key variables for moderate and extreme candidates in general elections.
The vote share of moderates are higher than extremists by 3 percentage points and the probability of victory is also higher for moderate by 13 percentage points.
It is worth noting that the ratio of the funds from party to those from political action committees is higher for extremists than moderates.

# Method

I estimated the RDD model with two different outcomes, general election vote share and general election victory, using the equation below.
The running variable is the winning vote margin of the extremist candidate whose value being above 0 indicates extremists' winning.

$$Y_{ipt} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 W_{ipt} + f(X_{ipt}) + \epsilon_{ipt}$$ The equation above estimates an effect of extremist's win $W_{ipt}$ in close primary elections on the general election outcomes $Y_{ipt}$ for each party $p$, district $i$, and year $t$.

Since the RDD estimates require a random assignment of the treatment variable, extreme candidate's winning, the bandwidth needs to be carefully chosen.
If the bandwidth is too large, it could be less accurate since it would include candidates who do not win or lose by a narrow margin.
On the other hand, if the bandwidth is too small, it could include more measurement errors.
Therefore, multiple bandwidths and specifications were explored following the specifications in @Hall (2015).

An important assumption for regression discontinuity design is that the outcomes be smooth around the cutoff, specifically around the winning margin of 0.
What this implies is that primary candidates should not have precise control over their election outcomes.
In primary elections, even if the candidates are aware that they are about to win or lose by a narrow margin, they have no way to precisely control the outcome to win.

# Results

![General Election Vote Share and Extremist Winning Margin](figure2.jpg){#fig-figure2 fig-align="center" width="70%"}

@fig-figure2 shows the general election vote share against the winning margin of the extremist candidate in the primary election.
To the right of the margin of 0, the extremist candidates won the election, and to the left, they lost.
Each side shows the slope of vote share against the margin.
Around the margin of 0, there is a drop in the general election vote share, suggesting a possible effect of extremist's winning on the general election vote share.

## Regression Results

The outcome variables of the estimated regression model are general election vote share and election victory.
Three different RD specifications were selected for each outcome: local linear and bandwidth of 5, Imbens-Kalyanaraman optimal bandwidth, and cubic, respectively.

![Regression Results for General Election Outcomes](images/reg_1.png){#fig-reg_general fig-align="center" width="80%"}

The table above (@fig-reg_general) shows the effect of extremist win on general election vote share and victory using local linear, Imbens-Kalyanaraman bandwidth and cubic specification.
The results suggest that, on average, extremist's winning of primary election causes a decrease in general election vote share by 8 to 12 percentage points.

Additionally, \@fig-reg-district above summarizes the different effects of extremists' wins in all districts, open elections, and safe districts.

## Results

![Summary Statistics (DIME)](images/summary_stats_rep-02.png){#fig-sum_stats_dime fig-align="center" width="80%"}

@fig-sum_stats_dime above shows the summary statistics for the extension dataset, DIME.
Vote share of moderate candidates in general election is higher than extreme candidates by 3 percentage points, and probability of victory is higher for moderate than extreme candidates by 6 percentage points, which are consistent with the summary statistics of vote share and victory on replication dataset.

## Regression Results 

The figure above (@fig-plot_extension_1) has extreme candidate's winning margin on x-axis and general election vote share on y-axis.
The blue lines are drawn on the subset of the dataset based on the treatment status.
Unlike @fig-figure2 on the replication dataset, it does not show a drop around the margin of 0, which implies that there is not a large difference in general election vote share for extreme candidates who narrowly win or lose primary elections.

![Regression Results 1980-2010 (DIME)](images/tb_extension_1.png){#fig-reg_table_extension_yrs fig-align="center" width="75%"}

@fig-reg_table_extension_yrs above shows the regression results for DIME dataset with years 1980 to 2010.
On average, the effects of extremist win on vote share are from 0.01 to 0.05 percentage points increase, and the cubic and IK bandwidth models have statistically significant results.
The effects on victory are not statistically significnat.
The point estimates overall suggest the opposite effect of extremist win on general election.

![Regression Results 1979-2020 (DIME)](images/tb_extension_2.png){#fig-tb_extension_2 fig-align="center" width="75%"}

@fig-tb_extension_2 below shows the regression results for the years 1979-2020.
For general election vote share, the effects of extremist's win is on average from 0 to 0.02 percentage points increase, and the coefficient for the IK bandwidth and cubic specifications were statistically significant.
For general election victory, the point estimates ranged from -0.05 to 0.1, but they were not statistically significant.

# Conclusion

In this paper, I replicated the study of @hall (2015) on the effects of extremist's wins in primary elections on the party's general election outcomes, specifically vote share and probability of victory.
The replication results suggest that an extremist's win causes a decline in general election vote share and probability of victory.
I conducted a further analysis using a dataset, DIME, which has more recent data, to investigate if similar results hold when including data for recent years.
The regression results, for both the same year range and with more recent data from DIME, suggest positive effects of extremists' victory on general election outcomes, which contradict Hall's study.
However, the results using DIME cannot be interpreted as the direction of the effects of extremists' win have recently changed since the analyses using the same years had different signs on the coefficients.
The possible reason for differing results is the difference in the measure of ideological distance in Hall's dataset and the CF scores in the DIME dataset.
